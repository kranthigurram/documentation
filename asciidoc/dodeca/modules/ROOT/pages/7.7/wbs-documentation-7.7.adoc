        By default, the argument value is TRUE.
        The argument value can be set to FALSE when there is no need to lookup a row within the data cache or when the first column potentially contains duplicate values.

| BackgroundExecute | Controls whether the function is executed asynchronous.
| Timeout | The numbers of seconds allowed to elapse before the execution of the function is timed out on the server.  The default value of 0 indicates that no timeout is enforced.
| CoverDuringExecute | Controls whether the view is covered while the custom function is executing.

This long-time Dodeca customer, has many examples of reports that save time and money.  One of their key management reports, which contains over 250 separate Essbase retrieval ranges, was automated saving weekend overtime for the corporate reporting department and bringing consistency and dependability to the process.  Another report, which was formerly generated daily at the store level, was automated using Dodeca and brought an estimated 1,500 man-hour per day time savings across the company.
