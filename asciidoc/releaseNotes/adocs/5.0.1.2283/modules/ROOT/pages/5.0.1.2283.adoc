This release addresses a couple of issues, including an issue with the
application-level request and response logging (#835) and an issue
encountered with using Excel outlining and relational groups when
outlining was enabled for more than two levels of grouping (#834).

We also discovered a typo in the New Vertical Tab Group tool caption.
This has been corrected in the default Admin toolbars configuration, in
the Standard Tools, and in the Starter Kit's View Console toolbars
configuration.

The correction will need to be made to any toolbars configuration that
is assigned to an application as the ToolbarsConfigurationID. Since most
Admin applications use the default Admin toolbars configuration (i.e.
UseDefaultAdminToolbarsConfiguration is set to True), then only the
toolbars configurations assigned to user applications will likely need
to be changed.

To correct the typo, select the toolbars configuration in the Toolbars
Configuration Metadata Editor, then open the Toolbars Designer.

Next, select the New Vertical Tab Group tool and edit the Caption.

Close the Toolbars Designer and commit the change.
